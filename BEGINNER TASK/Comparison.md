## 📊 Comparison Table

| Feature                  | Matplotlib                            | Seaborn                                   |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Ease of Use**          | Medium – requires more manual setup    | High – handles details automatically       |
| **Customization**        | Very High – full control of every part | Medium – built-in styling, less manual     |
| **Interactivity**        | Basic (via matplotlib widgets)         | Limited (uses Matplotlib backend)          |
| **Data Handling**        | Works with lists, arrays, Series       | Works best with pandas DataFrames          |
| **Visual Aesthetics**    | Manual styling                         | Beautiful default themes and palettes      |
| **Performance**          | Fast, even for large datasets          | Fast, but slightly slower for very large data |
| **Plot Variety**         | All types including 3D & pie charts    | Best for statistical and structured plots  |
| **Learning Curve**       | Steeper for beginners                  | Easier for beginners with clean output     |
| **Use Case**             | Custom & detailed plots                | Quick EDA and statistical visualizations   |
| **Code Length**          | More lines to customize                | Less code for clean, styled visuals        |

## ✅ Summary

- Use **Matplotlib** when:
  - You need full control over every plot element
  - You want to build complex or publication-quality visualizations
  - You’re working outside of DataFrames or doing advanced plot types (like 3D, pie, etc.)

- Use **Seaborn** when:
  - You’re doing **data analysis or EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**
  - You want fast, clean, and attractive statistical plots with **minimal code**
  - You’re working with **pandas DataFrames**

> 🔁 Pro Tip: You can **combine** Seaborn and Matplotlib together!  
Use Seaborn for layout and data, then tweak details using Matplotlib functions like `plt.title()`, `plt.xlabel()`, etc.
